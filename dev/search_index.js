It is a numerical tool for electric field propagation in optical waveguide structures using the beam propagation method. For an in-depth explanation of the purpose and the math read the paper[Veettikazhy2021] by the original BPM-Matlab authors. The package is for the most part a direct reimplementation of the Matlab code, however there are some differences (see below). The most important benefit of this package is the pure Julia implementation. Therefore this package runs on any system which runs Julia 1.6. I have not performed an \"scientific\" benchmarks but replicating figure 1 of [Veettikazhy2021] takes less than 30s on a i7-4850HQ with only a single update and 2 minutes with 50 updates, indicating that performance is limited by the visualization at the moment.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The syntax for using BeamPropagationMethod.jl is very simlar to BPM-Matlab but had to be adapted for Julia specifics. Check the examples in order to get started. It might be worthwile to check the BPM-Matlab Readme for an explanation of the structure.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Features","page":"Introduction","title":"Features","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Native Julia implementation\nMulti-Threading support\nCalculate electric field propagation for arbitrary refractive index profiles\nFD-BPM and FFT (Fresnel) propagation code for solving the Helmholtz equation (i.e. only low refractive index contrast, no vector information, polarization, ...)\nMode solver for determining the eigenmodes of an refractive index profile\nSupport for non-trivially transforming refractive mode index profiles, allowing to model waveguide building blocks (Splitters, Mach-Zehnder-Modulators, Photonic Lanterns)\nVisualization and video export using Plots.jl\nProgress monitor","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Introduction","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Install the package using the package manager:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"] add BeamPropagationMethod","category":"page"},{"location":"#License","page":"Introduction","title":"License","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
